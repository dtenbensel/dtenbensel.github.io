                            <p><strong>About:</strong> This application was part of a school assignment for a Capstone course. The assignment was to develop a mobile application that would
                            improve vistor experience of the park. The application needed to be useful to visitors before they arrive and provide information
                            while the visitors are inside the park. The application should allow the visitors the ability to add data to a database.</p>
                            <p><strong>Process:</strong> The first thing that I did was to think of a park to use for the application. I decided to use Great Smoky Mountains
                            since my family has visited the park a couple of times. Some of the layers that I included in the park include: trails, ranger stations
                            , restroom locations, picnic areas, and a weather layer from the National Weather Service. The application has a side panel that allows the user
                            to filter the layers based on the different counties that make up the park. Some of the features in the application include a show my location, search button,
                            and an ability for the user to add problem locations. The show my location feature uses the device's GPS to show the user where they are within the park.
                            The search button allows the user to search for different trails within the park. When the user adds a problem location, a dialog box appears where the user
                            can enter the location and description of the problem along with the date. After the user clicks submit, the layer is updated to show the newly added feature.</p>
