                            <p><br><strong>Technology Used:</strong> ESRI ArcGIS for JavaScript API</p>
                            <p><strong>About:</strong> My wife and I recently moved to Houston and we would hear all these restaurants that we needed to try, but could never
                            remember the restaurants when it was time to pick somewhere to eat. I created this application to solve this problem. While I was creating the
                            application, I saw that a food critic created a top 100 list in the Houston area. I decided to add the restaurants from his list along with the
                            restaurants that my wife and I decided we would try. I created a filter for the top 100 restaurants. This filter is based on the prices. I also
                            created two different feature actions that are available on the popup window. The first feature action will give the user directions from their
                            current location to the restuarant. The second feature action has a link to the restuarant menu.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Process:</strong> I created a feature layer of both the top 100 restaurants and the restaurants my wife and I want to visit. I created
                            a custom popup template using ESRI's Arcade language. Next, I created the filter functionality using the attributes of the top 100 restaurants.
                            Creating the direction feature action was a little bit difficult since I never worked with the route task. I also created a unique renderer for
                            the restaurants based on whether it was a top 100 restaurant or if I've visited it.
